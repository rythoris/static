Static is a simple and experimental static site generator script build on top of
pandoc (https://pandoc.org), stemp (https://github.com/rythoris/stemp) and
frontmatter (https://github.com/rythoris/frontmatter).

Static is build with the UNIX philosophy in mind, it is designed to do one thing
and that is to build pages from markdown files. It converts the Markdown to HTML
using pandoc and uses stemp templates to make beautiful yet simple websites.

Installation
============

Just download the script!

     $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rythoris/static/refs/heads/master/static

Getting Started
===============

To see the `static` in action please refer to the 'example_site' directory and
specifically the 'example_site/build.sh' script. I've wrote some comments in that
script that will help you get started with `static`.
